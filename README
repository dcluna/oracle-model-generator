= Description
A library for generating an ActiveRecord model from an existing Oracle table.
This will install an "omg" executable that you can use from the command line.

= Synopsis
Using the command line tool:

  omg -d your_database -t your_table -u some_user -p some_password

Results in a file called "your_table.rb". This is an ActiveRecord model
declaration, with all validations, primary keys, table name and belongs_to
relationships defined.

= Requirements
== Must Have
* ruby-oci8
* getopt

== Optional
If you want to be able to avoid specifying a username and password on the
command line then you will need the dbi-dbrc library.

If you want your models to support multiple primary keys, then you will
need to install the composite_primary_keys library.

If you want date format validations, then you will need to install the
validates_timeliness library.

= What this library doesn't do
I do not attempt to set has_many or has_one relationships. There's no good
way to determine that relationship (one or many?). Besides, in practice I
find that most people set custom has_xxx relationships that go over and
above what's set in the Oracle database anyway for purposes of their
application.

I also do not go out of my way to get the model name correct with regards
to singular vs plural. I do a simple guess that covers most cases, but
complex cases will break it. It's much easier for you to rename a class or
file name than it is for me to get this 100% correct.

= Author's Comments
I chose not to patch legacy_data because I have no interest in supporting
other vendors other than Oracle with this library. By focusing only on
Oracle I could take advantage of ruby-oci8 features. In addition, I have no
interest in making this a Rails plugin, and I needed the support of multiple
primary keys.

= Future Plans
Add support for views.
