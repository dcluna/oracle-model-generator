= Description
A library for generating an ActiveRecord model from an existing Oracle table.

= Synopsis
From the command line:

generate_oracle_model --table users
generate_oracle_model --view employees

= Author's Comments
I chose not to patch legacy_data because I have no interest in supporting
other vendors other than Oracle with this library. By focusing only on
Oracle I could take advantage of ruby-oci8 features. In addition, I have no
interest in making this a Rails plugin, and I needed the support of multiple
primary keys.
