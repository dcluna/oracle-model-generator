= 0.2.0 - 8-Mar-2011
* Added the -r/--rails command line option. By default the omg binary will
  now generate Rails 3 style validations. If you want Rails 2 validations,
  specify "-r 2" on the command line.
* The numericality validations are now more strict, and will match the
  scale and precision exactly as defined instead of rounding to the nearest
  whole number, for Rails 3 anyway.

= 0.1.0 - 6-Oct-2010
* Initial release.
