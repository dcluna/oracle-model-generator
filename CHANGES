= 0.3.0 - ???
* The dependencies method now returns an array of dependencies for the given
  table or view.
* The table method has been altered. It now returns just the plain, uppercased
  name of the table. A new method called 'model' now returns the active record
  model name.
* More tests and comments added.

= 0.2.1 - 3-May-2011
* Fixed a bug where the omg binary blew up if you didn't have the dbi-dbrc
  library installed. It's supposed to be optional. Thanks go to Jason Roth
  for the spot.

= 0.2.0 - 8-Mar-2011
* Added the -r/--rails command line option. By default the omg binary will
  now generate Rails 3 style validations. If you want Rails 2 validations,
  specify "-r 2" on the command line.
* The numericality validations are now more strict, and will match the
  scale and precision exactly as defined instead of rounding to the nearest
  whole number, for Rails 3 anyway.

= 0.1.0 - 6-Oct-2010
* Initial release.
